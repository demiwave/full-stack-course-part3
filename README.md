## A true full stack developer's oath
It is again time for the exercises. The complexity of our app has now taken another step since besides frontend and backend we also have a database. There are indeed really many potential sources of error.

So we should once more extend our oath:

Full stack development is extremely hard, that is why I will use all the possible means to make it easier

- I will have my browser developer console open all the time
- I will use the network tab of the browser dev tools to ensure that frontend and backend are communicating as I expect
- I will constantly keep an eye on the state of the server to make sure that the data sent there by the frontend is saved there as I expect
- I will keep an eye on the database: does the backend save data there in the right format
- I progress with small steps
- I will write lots of console.log statements to make sure I understand how the code behaves and to help pinpoint problems
- If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead, I start deleting the code until it works or just return to a state when everything was still working
- When I ask for help in the course Discord channel or elsewhere I formulate my questions properly, see [here](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/general_info#how-to-ask-help-in-discord) how to ask for help
